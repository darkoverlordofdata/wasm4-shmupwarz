[artemis](http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/artemis-entity-system-framework) is a ecs engine written in java by gamadu

unfortunately the original source code vanished. there are upgrade and ports but i want the smallest version so i'm using my own typescript port as the base (https://github.com/darkoverlordofdata/artemists)


### notes
* use ulong for all ints for size_t compat
